I am a final year undergraduate at Concordia University, Montreal studying Mathematics and Statistics.
My research is focused on Reinforcement Learning and it's real-life applications. I am curious about integrating temporal abstraction in autonomous agents, so that they can learn and plan at multiple levels of hierarchy at the same time.
I also think about immediate applications of RL to tackle problems like [climate change](https://github.com/konichuvak/hotrl).
Outside of research, I enjoy chess, [rock climbing](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMuv_53KYDaQAUiO5VjdN5d3okVLel7uD6aSBTjP0QKOjCvY-s7Ax_cH87ZtG28_A?key=SmJkVlk2TUwyVlZIbnR2bTdlV0tqeExBOERLaThB), and [hiking](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNAjoFmZcTkeP0KuT2eM4nnvdpAt8FyP9yuHC852i3Nj-JXZ8ZDwZAjGiuWvQXlQA?key=M0JKekJFNC1COU1oenRjZTd0dUl2VUxwUkdtWEt3).

## Math

I very much enjoy solving math riddles in my spare time. I have a long jupyter notebook with solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) that I need to post to github at some point.
